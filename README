These are my VIM settings.

A video showing what I can do with these when I code C++ is here:

Use MPlayer (http://www.mplayerhq.hu) or VideoLAN (http://www.videolan.org/) to play it.
I also tried uploading it to Youtube, but quality is really low, even in HD setting:

I use a small number of plugins, and did some minor customization for shortcuts:

- I maintain my plugins with pathogen, and use Git submodules to always
  have the latest versions. 

- In any new machine/account I need to work on, I clone:

    # get to home
    cd 
    git clone https://github.com/ttsiodras/dotvim .vim
    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd ..
    ln -s .vim/.vimrc

  And therefore use the same environment everywhere.

- I create /usr/include/tags:

    (become root via su/sudo)
    cd /usr/include
    ctags -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .

  ... and my .vimrc is set to use these, as well as any local tags I build
  in my Makefiles:

    set tags+=/usr/include/tags

- I use clang complete ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302 )
  to get Intellisense-like autocompletion. 

- I've mapped:
    NERDTreeToggle to F10, for direct access to "file manager" interface :-)
    Ctrl-cursors to navigate windows (under both XTerms and GVim)
    Ctrl-L to clear search results (hate seeing yellow stuff)
    Ctrl-End to quickly close "window" (buffer)
    K to show manpages in "inner window" (allows me to copy/paste)
    F6 to show taglists (macros/types/variables/functions/classes)
    
- For my Python needs, I use:
    PyFlakes for "edit-time compiling" :-)
    F8 to run pep8 (perfectionism)

Am I insane to use VIM?
