Step 1: Open a terminal/shell to the place where your PHP code is:

    bash$ export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=session_name"

Step 2: Open a terminal/shell, spawn vim/gvim and hit F5. It will
        tell you that it will wait for a connection in the next
        10 seconds

Step 3: In the first terminal, run your PHP code (within 10 sec)

    bash$ php5 ./myPhpCode.php

Step 4: Enjoy your full-blown PHP IDE inside your VIM!
